## Installation
To run this project, I used Python 3 and installed the following libraries: numpy, pandas and plotly express.

## Motivation
As part of my Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science, I ran an exploratory analysis on teen births in the United States using data from The National Vital Statistics System. This dataset includes birth rates by state for females aged 15–19 years from 1940 to 2016 grouped into two age buckets 15–17 years and 18–19 years. The questions I have listed is as follows:

- How does the birth rate for Females Aged 15–19 years differ over the years ?
- What are the States with the highest number of teen births in 2016?
- How do total births compare among the two age groups ?

## File Descriptions
The analysis can be found in this [file](https://github.com/Reefatig/Birth-Rates-Project/blob/main/Teen%20Birth%20Rates.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook demonstrates all the related work to answer the questions above. It includes the preprocessing steps required for the analysis. Additionally, it includes all the Plotly visualizations used to answer these questions. 

## Results
The results can be found in this Medium [post](https://medium.com/@rfatig/teen-births-where-you-live-matters-a65207a32d58).
